      <p class="paragraph-content">We found ourselves beginning our journey with an exceedingly ambiguous project description. Our goal was to employ user-centered design to speculate about novel user experiences in digital television that would satisfy user needs that are expected to emerge in the next 3 years. Our team used a variety of brainstorming activities, research methods, synthesis and design methodologies to narrow down our scope and get to the root of the problem we aimed to solve for. This section details brief summaries for each method and the most noteworthy insights and outcomes that have resulted.</p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-heading heading-space-long">Pretotype</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-content">Since the first television program to air in 1928, the television format and the consumption of digital content itself has undergone major shifts and now comprises an essential fabric in modern society. Coming into a project with such a broad aim, we needed to find a way to explore the space of digital television without losing sight of the bigger picture and wasting unnecessary time and resources.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-line"></div>
      <p class="paragraph-content">We had recently had a conversation with our client discussing key assumptions around television that could be worth exploring. This got us thinking… Can we transport participants into a future state where these assumptions are reversed? Examples of such assumptions were the use of certain controls, the two dimensional format of TV and the fact that its static. We also wanted to explore factors such as immersion and social behaviors within this state.</p><img src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/plugins/Basic/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-2">
      <p class="paragraph-content">We introduce our Pretotype, the Context Aware Moving Television, and the Visuo-auditory Immersion System. These were scenarios where the television has been freed from the bounds of a static two dimensional artifact and where the television is capable of providing enhanced 3D projection and surround sound audio.</p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-heading heading-space-short">affinity diagramming</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-content">Through affinity diagramming we’ve condensed the qualitative data from the sessions and interviews. What became apparent to us is that television has already broken the bounds of its traditional box within the living room wall, not just ergonomically, but also conceptually. While the reason people watch TV has not changed, the ability to have it within the palm of one’s hand has brought with it, a need for robustness and adaptability that users have come to expect.</p><img src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/plugins/Basic/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-3">

      <h3 class="paragraph-heading heading-space-short">contextual inquiry</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-content">It was at this point that we realized that there is more to the shift within the digital television landscape than just the delivery mechanism, but to the content itself. We also needed to understand what TV and digital content means to users in a real-life context.</p><img src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/plugins/Basic/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-3">
      <p class="paragraph-content">With our new focus on digital content and its role in real-life routines, we began our deep exploration into how TV blends itself into people’s daily lives and how different content fit into varying contexts. We did so by conducting contextual inquiries and diary studies with a pool of participants with diverse demographic backgrounds. We then conducted 5-Whys sessions to get into the root of the problem. What we found was that many of our pretotype insights were reliably validated, and that there are surprising needs that are being specifically met with the use of digital content, especially within a content capturing and sharing perspective.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-content">We now have a solid understanding of the ebb and flow of digital content in the current state, but what about the future? If there is one thing we know about the incorporation of technology when transitioning into the future, it&#x27;s that it is not enough for it to push the boundaries of what’s possible, but to be the solution that people are ready to embrace. So… What are people willing to embrace in the future?</p><img src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/plugins/Basic/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-3">
